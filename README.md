Task: Build a Collapsible Sidebar using HTML, CSS & JavaScript ğŸ’¡

In this project, I developed a sidebar that:
- Slides in smoothly from the top-left corner of the screen ğŸ“±
- Includes a logo and a navigation list with icons ğŸ“š
- Features a toggle button to open the sidebar (â‰¡) and a close button (âœ–) to close it ğŸ”„
- Works responsively on different screen sizes and orientations ğŸ“Š
